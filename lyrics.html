         Salt air, and the rust on your door
        I never needed anything more
        Whispers of "Are you sure?"
        "Never have I ever before"

        But I can see us lost in the memory
        August slipped away into a moment in time
        Cause it was never mine
        And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
        August sipped away like a bottle of wine
        'Cause you were never mine

        Your back beneath the sun
        Wishin' I could write my name on it
        Will you call when you're back at school?
        I remember thinkin' I had you

        But I can see us lost in the memory
        August slipped away into a moment in time
        'Cause it was never mine
        And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
        August sipped away like a bottle of wine
        'Cause you were never mine

        Back when we were still changin' for the better
        Wanting was enough
        For me, it was enough
        To live for the hope of it all
        Cancel plans just in case you'd call
        And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
        So much for summer love and saying "us"
        'Cause you weren't mine to lose
        You weren't mine to lose, no

        But I can see us lost in the memory
        August slipped away into a moment in time
        'Cause it was never mine
        And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
        August sipped away like a bottle of wine
        'Cause you were never mine
        'Cause you were never mine, never mine

        But do you remember?
        Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
        And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
        Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
        "Meet me behind the mall"

        (Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car")
        (And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
        (Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
        ("Meet me behind the mall")

        Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
        And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
        Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)

        For the hope of it all
        For the hope of it all
        (For the hope of it all)
        (For the hope of it all)
